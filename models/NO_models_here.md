# Model File (model.h5) Not Included  

The model file `model.h5` is too large to be hosted on GitHub (GitHub limits files to 25 MB).  

You can download the model from my Kaggle profile here:  
link: https://www.kaggle.com/zlatan599 or in my bio  
Please place the downloaded `model.h5` file into the `models/` folder inside the project directory, like this:

your_project/  
├── GUI.py  
├── models/  
│ └── model.h5  
└── assets  
│ └── LOGO.png  

Without this file, the app will not run properly.  
Thank you for understanding!
